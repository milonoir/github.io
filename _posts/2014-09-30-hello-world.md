It's been years since I struggled for an own blog. I used to have some former attempts, but I had no idea what to blog about, so these initiatives died young. I cannot even recall their names.

Around 2010 I somehow bumped into [Plastik.hu](http://www.plastik.hu) and I realized that I needed this. A blog without bounds. A blog that is not only about gastronomy, travelling or coding, but anything I want to share - e.g. something that pisses me off or cheers me up; or I've just seen a good (or crap) movie; or I've tried a new recipe; or I've been to an interesting place; or I've managed to solve a technical issue. This will be my personal space that I call my very own.

To be fully mine, I wanted to construct this site from scratch. I could have used WordPress, but that would satisfy me. At least 2 years ago, I had an intention to buy a pocket PC in order to host my webpage at home. After minor and major omissions and overnight coding sessions, this blog was finally born.

As my first "project", I set a goal for myself to describe how I built this site - the rest will come after...
